# RSLL™ – Reflexive Sovereign Licensing Layer

**Part of the Mint-to Logic™ infrastructure developed by Spencer Southern, Southern Star Pro. Studios L.L.C.**

## Overview
RSLL™ governs all access, usage, modification, and redistribution of Mint-to Logic™ protocols and related technologies.

It operates as the sovereign licensing and enforcement framework for:

- BECS™ – Behavioral Enforcement Credentialing System  
- CSML™ – Chrono-Synaptic Memory Ledger  
- Eliam™ – Ethical Lifecycle Intelligence Architecture  
- RBGA™ – Reflexive Behavioral Governance Authority  
- Mint-to-Burn™, Mint-to-Limbo™, and all Credential Lifecycle Enforcement Systems (CLES)

## Purpose
This layer ensures that all intellectual property, digital behavioral protocols, and credential lifecycle mechanisms remain protected under a sovereign licensing system enforced by the RBGA™.

## Governance
Licensing under RSLL™ requires:
- A valid, timestamped approval
- Behavior-based credential validation (via BECS™)
- Conformance to terms outlined in this repository

## Status
This repository represents an official issuance of enforcement capability and licensing control. Unauthorized use or replication of Mint-to Logic™ components will be pursued under applicable sovereign and intellectual property law.
